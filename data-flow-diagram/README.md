# Airbnb Clone - Data Flow Diagram

This directory contains the **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** for the Airbnb Clone project.

## Files
- **data-flow.png** → Visual representation of the system’s data flow.
- **README.md** → Documentation of this directory.

## Overview
The DFD maps how data moves through the Airbnb backend system, showing the interactions between:
- **Users** (guests, hosts)
- **Admins**
- **Payment Gateway**

### Key Processes
1. **User Authentication** – handles login, registration, and identity management.  
2. **Property Management** – allows hosts to add, update, and manage properties.  
3. **Booking Management** – enables guests to search and book available properties.  
4. **Payment Processing** – integrates with external payment gateways to handle transactions.  
5. **Review System** – allows users to leave feedback on properties.  

### Data Stores
